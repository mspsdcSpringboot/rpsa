            <h4>About The Commission</h4>
            <p class="text-justify">
                The Meghalaya Right to Public Services Act, 2020 was enacted by the State to guarantee citizenâ€™s right to time-bound delivery of notified citizen-related services from Government offices. The Commission was set up to oversee, monitor and regulate the implementation of this Act. It has the jurisdiction, powers and functions to ensure that notified public services to citizens of the State are provided and to impose penalty on delinquent public officers if they fail to deliver an entitled service within the stipulated time.
            </p>
            <p class="text-justify">
                Presently, 187 services of various Government Departments have been notified under this Act. Citizens who apply for any of these services have the right to receive these services in time and can approach the Commission as the second Appellate Authority in case the services have been denied or delayed wrongfully.
            </p>
